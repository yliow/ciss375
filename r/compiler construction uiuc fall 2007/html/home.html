<h3>Textbook </h3> 

<ul> The textbook for the class is <a
href="http://www.aw-bc.com/catalog/academic/product/0,1144,0321486811,00.html">
<em> Compilers - Principles, Techniques, and Tools (2nd Edition)
</em></a> by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman, published by Addison-Wesley.
This is the well known "dragon book."  Please note that we are using
the recently released <b>second edition</b> of the book.  The first
edition is out of date.  Copies of this book are on reserve at
Grainger Engineering Library.  </ul>

<h3>
Course Newsgroup
</h3>
<ul>

You will be using the class newsgroup <a href="news:class.cs426">
class.cs426</a> for questions to the instructor and discussions among
yourselves.  Please do not use this newsgroup for any posts
other than those relating to the course. 

<p>
<i>NOTE: No solutions or code should be posted by students on the newsgroup.
Only the instructors may post solutions or hints. </i>

<p>
If you have not read news at UIUC before, you can find information on
accessing the newsgroup <a
href="https://agora.cs.uiuc.edu/display/tsg/news.cs.uiuc.edu">here</a>.
The server for reading news is <tt>news.cs.uiuc.edu</tt>.

</ul>

<h3>
Lecture Notes
</h3>
<ul>
Copies of the slides used in class will be posted on the
course Web page before each class.  This way, you do not need to
copy down material on the slides.  Nevertheless, you <b>should</b> take
detailed notes during the lectures.
 
<p>
<b><i>NOTE: The slides are generally sparse, containing only brief bullets on
key points.  For example, they are insufficient for studying for
exams.  Please make sure to take notes during the lectures.</i></b>

</ul>

<h3>
Homeworks and Exams
</h3>
<ul>
There will be two homeworks and two exams, spaced out over the course
of the semester.  The midterm exam will be in class on October 25.
The final exam will be at the normal time scheduled by the University
for our class slot.
</ul>

<h3>
Grading Policy
</h3>
<ul>

<table border=1>
<td>        	<td>UG or 0.75 unit grads	<td>1-unit grads<tr><tr>
<td>Project	<td>40%			<td>52%<tr>
<td>Homeworks	<td>20%			<td>16%<tr>
<td>Exams 	<td>40% 		<td>32%<tr>
</table>


<h4> Project grading </h4>

The project will be due in four parts, and will be graded as the semester
progresses.

Graduate students who are taking the course for 1 unit will be required to
do a fifth and more substantial part during roughly the second half of the
semester.  The total score for the semester will be computed by scaling all
the basic course components by 0.8, and giving the unit project a weighting of
0.2, i.e.,
<br><tt>Total = 0.8 * BasicTotal + 0.2 * UnitProjectScore</tt></br>

<h4> Grad students vs. undergrads</h4>
Graduate students will be graded separately from undergraduate students. 

</ul>

<h3>
Project Description
</h3>

<ul>
This class has a semester project divided into four MPs.  The overall
goals for the project will be described on the course project page
shortly.
</ul>

<h3>
Computing Facilities
</h3>

<ul>
<li> We will use the EWS machines for the programming projects.
See <a href="http://www.ews.uiuc.edu/">the EWS web site</a> for more
information. 

<!-- on the first floor of DCL.
     The machine names are <tt>csil-suna[0-48].cs.uiuc.edu</tt> and
     <tt>csil-sunb[1-40].cs.uiuc.edu</tt>.
     The <A HREF="http://www.cs.uiuc.edu/class/cs426/facilities.html" TARGET="_top">
     CSIL facilities page</A> explains precisely which labs have SPARCs.
-->

<li> All students should automatically have accounts assigned.  You are
     responsible for getting your own passwords and making sure you can
     access the account in the first week of classes.

</ul>

<h3>
Course Policies
</h3>
<ul>

<h4> Incomplete MPs </h4>
<ul>

10 points are reserved for completely working MPs with no significant
errors. So if your MP is not working (with respect to the test files we
use), expect to lose 10 points right away.<br><BR>

Also, all the MPs (except the first one) are dependent on the previous ones.
If you could not get a previous MP working, and don't want to finish it before you start on the next one, then you can get the previous MP solution from the TA but with a penalty of 10% on the next one.  For example, in MP3 you are supposed to use your MP2 solution and if you could not get MP2 working before starting on MP3, you can get our code for MP2 from the TA, but you will be penalized 10% on MP3. Though this means you will be penalized twice for not finishing an MP, an important aspect of this project is building a working compiler, not just building a piece, then throwing it away before building the next one. <BR><BR>

</ul>
<h4> Lateness </h4>
<ul>
Late programming assignments will be penalized 2 points per hour
late (or fraction
thereof), counted from 5pm on the due date.&nbsp; <b>This means being
several hours late could affect your grade</b>.
<p>There are two circumstances for which we'll give &quot;free&quot; extensions:</p>

<ul>
<li> <em>Serious personal problems</em>. These will be dealt with individually. They are 
typically either <em>serious</em> illness to you (doctor's verification required) or
a major family emergency.<br>
<li> <em> Extended lab downtime</em>. This is extremely rare. A whole day of
  downtime in the
lab <em>might</em> qualify. Minor downtime <em>does not</em> qualify. "Flakiness all
weekend" <em>does not</em> qualify. Accidental loss of files does <i>not</i>
  qualify.&nbsp; If you have chosen
to work on some other machine other than the designated class machines, then you do so
at your own risk. To protect yourself, keep recent backups on the class machines so 
that if your machine breaks, you can recover. 
</ul>
</ul>

<h4> Cheating </h4>
<ul>
<p> You are NOT to copy solutions from ANY source 
(including, but not limited to, books, people, old class notes or 
handouts).
While the pressures of many classes, homeworks, work and/or extracurricular 
activities can be great, this is <b>never</b> an excuse for copying solutions 
from others. "Helping" somebody by allowing them to "borrow" your homework is 
not doing them a favor either, but indicates your approval and active 
participation in such activities.&nbsp; Refer to the Campus Code regarding academic
integrity.&nbsp; Cheating 
will result in a reduced grade, or a grade "E" for the course. If you are 
aware of any breach of academic integrity, it is your responsibility to 
report it to the instructor.<br><br>

Discussing your problems with other students, however, <i>is </i>encouraged and
even highly recommended. This means asking someone to look at parts of your code
to give you advice, asking them for suggestions when you face an obstacle,
working out example exercises together that are not on an assigned homework, or just
discussing any aspect of the material.&nbsp; What you may <i>not </i>do is to
copy or any in way use code or homework solutions written by anyone else or
dictated by anyone else.&nbsp; As responsible adults, you can draw the distinction
between cheating and honest behavior: exercise your judgement and try to
preserve the highest level of professional integrity in everything you do.</p>

<p>
<i>Bottom line: You may discuss difficulties with others and get
occasional help with debugging but
<b>you must write your code entirely by yourself</b>.</i></p>

</ul>
</ul>

<h3>
How to Get the Most out of this Course
</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Read the text as it is quite thorough, with many examples 
    worked out, good motivating discussions, and useful intuition.</li>
  <li>Participate actively in class: ask questions when you don't understand
    something, and share in the in-class exercises.</li>
  <li>Do the homeworks and project assignments ahead of time whenever
    possible.&nbsp; Working madly to beat a deadline is a terrible way to learn!</li>
</ol>
